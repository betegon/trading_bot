## TODO
1. identify whethere a level is a resistance or a support right now (TODAY). Now support or resistance is based in the time it formed, but it could have been broken from then until now.
2. Note when a level stopped being relevant (many broken times, many candles, etc). sometimes we maybe are taking into account a level that is irrelevant as it was from a year ago and now it is nothing.
